Most people don’t realize how much they're spending on recurring subscriptions — and how that money could’ve grown if invested wisely. **Subscription Trap Analyzer™** is a one-of-a-kind personal finance project built in Google Colab that not only analyzes recurring expenses, but also adds emotional insight, behavioral tagging, and investment regret simulation to deliver an unforgettable financial reality check.

This project turns simple transaction data into powerful, personalized financial insights.
